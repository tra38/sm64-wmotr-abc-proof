# CLAUDE.md — working in this repo

A Rocq (Coq) + CompCert proof aimed at an SM64 **A-Button-Challenge impossibility**
result. Two rules dominate everything you do here.

## 1. Before ANY proof work, read the `proof-discipline` skill

Before you continue, extend, "finish", or discharge a proof — or add a
`Definition`/`Lemma`/`Axiom` — invoke **`/proof-discipline`**
(`.claude/skills/proof-discipline/SKILL.md`) and run its audit:

```bash
bash .claude/skills/proof-discipline/discipline_check.sh
```

A green build is **not** progress, and proving a true-looking lemma is **not**
progress if it is disconnected, vacuous, or self-invented. Progress = a goal
**capstone** resting on *fewer* assumptions, with new work **hooked into the
spine** (not left in `Unwired/`). The failure mode to avoid is la-la-land:
inventing definitions and proving a tower on top of them while drifting from the
real theorem. (See <https://leanprover-community.github.io/did_you_prove_it.html>.)

## 2. PIPELINE, not bespoke

Every fact about SM64 comes from the mechanically `clightgen`'d Clight AST under
`generated/` — **never** a hand-written model. Hand-written math lives in
`proofs/`; `generated/` is regenerated, never edited. (`README.md`,
`proofs/README.md`.)

## Build & verify — always via `pipeline/*.sh`, never bare `coqc`

```bash
bash pipeline/build.sh proofs                       # build the proofs (committed generated/)
bash pipeline/assumptions.sh <Module.Path> <thm>    # Print Assumptions (the lie detector)
python3 pipeline/check_unwired.py                    # structure: unused => unwired (CI-enforced)
bash .claude/skills/proof-discipline/discipline_check.sh   # the full discipline audit
```

The active **spine** is the transitive closure of the goal capstone
(`NoAImpliesNoFly/NoAImpliesNoFly.v` for GOAL 1 — no-A ⇒ no-fly;
`WMotRRequiresA/` is GOAL 2, not started). Everything else lives under an
`Unwired/` dir: compiled, but **not load-bearing**. CI's firewall forbids the
spine from importing `Unwired/`, so the only way to "use" Unwired work is to
promote it. See `proofs/README.md` and `docs/RENAMING.md`.

## Standing reporting instruction

For every future response about the pyramid proof project, keep
`SSL-Coq/less-than-one-a-press/docs/no-a-route-atlas.md` and the private
<https://pyramid-proof-fine-print.tra38.chatgpt.site> consistent with the
findings, corrections and decisions being reported. The site source is in
the sibling `pyramid-proof-assumptions-site` project. Update and publish
changed site content before the final reply, using the Sites skills and
preserving its private access. If nothing changed, do not invent progress.
Keep the atlas's three summary sections as single paragraphs, retain honest
proof boundaries, and copy its subjective counterexample estimates accurately.
Do not publish conversation exports.
