(** The stronger Rank-1 source boundary also closes the ordinary named-source
    ingress for a duplicate PLAYER object and audits the live floor-query data
    structure.  Every non-plain [Surface *] derivation is one of four
    pointer-preserving identity casts or the defined pool index; the node
    lineage has only its allocator, clear, and insertion writers.  The result
    intentionally leaves live [gCurrentObject] identity, already escaped or
    type-punned aliases, exact outside effects, and object/surface epochs for
    the continuous-execution proof. *)

(** The whole selected US/JP source now has an exhaustive destination-root
    census for [struct Surface].  Every rooted assignment is in the surface
    loader except three [originOffset] stores, and generated Clight shows that
    each of those first binds the separate water pseudo-floor, copies that
    binding to an unchanged temporary, and stores through the temporary.  The
    queried static/dynamic floor is therefore not a hidden post-load writer. *)
Theorem current_rank1_surface_write_source_boundary :

Proof. exact area1_surface_write_closure_boundary_holds. Qed.

(** The six named Rank-1 survivors are now separated by outcome.  Ordinary
    direct and stock indirect callbacks cannot change [gCurrentObject]; the
    ordinary behavior/list constructor chain cannot append another PLAYER
    node; and the projected stock upper-warp query has no alternate floor.
    A stale cached object is genuinely possible.  Public surface-pool pointers
    into the shared main pool, the remaining outside effects, and the live
    allocator/query projection stay explicit rather than being framed away. *)
Theorem current_rank1_six_residual_audit_boundary :
  Area1Rank1SixResidualAuditBoundary.
Proof. exact area1_rank1_six_residual_audit_boundary_holds. Qed.

(** Rank 1's shared-main-pool residual is now a byte-range question rather
    than a free-form type-punning possibility.  The accepted JP receipt fixes
    both payload ranges and the live allocator heads; the inductive epoch
    relation preserves them through successful left/right allocations and
    safe state restoration.  The complete generated-source census fixes every
    main-pool allocator and epoch-mutator caller, while the machine receipt
    fixes the direct store/call projection of the five remaining JP roots.
    Any failed CompCert frame must be a same-block store whose byte interval
    actually overlaps a protected payload.  The live-list theorem projects a
    selected node to the finite stock-floor model once real insertion/clear
    execution and transitive descriptor validity inhabit its trace. *)
Theorem current_rank1_surface_pool_range_and_floor_projection_boundary :
  Area1SurfacePoolRangeSeparationBoundary.
Proof. exact area1_surface_pool_range_separation_boundary_holds. Qed.

(** The first continuous retail-JP frame receipt now instantiates the abstract
    range/list boundary.  A real graphics allocation starts exactly at the
    surface payload's exclusive end and is freed back to that boundary; all
    238 reached pool writes are classified; six owner stores pair with six
    insertions and survive the complete list scan; and the final query returns
    the exact stock static floor at the spawn position.  This rules out the
    six named escapes in that frame, while deliberately leaving universal
    extension to a target upper-warp frame as the remaining proof step. *)
Theorem current_rank1_live_boundary_receipt :
  Area1Rank1LiveBoundaryCheckedBoundary.
Proof. exact area1_rank1_live_boundary_checked_boundary_holds. Qed.

(** The continuous receipt now extends that first-frame boundary through one
    real zero-A four-pillar route and the upper-warp action.  All 2,462 frame
    checks pass; every [find_floor] entry has a checked return; every dynamic
    return observes its installed live owner; and Mario's final platform
    selection is ownerless and static in every audited frame.  The pyramid
    top's explosion creates six inactive-owner triangles for one frame, but
    none is returned after invalidation and the next clear precedes every
    query.  This closes the named escapes for this execution, not for every
    possible controller history or execution outside the selected model. *)
Theorem current_rank1_upper_warp_trace_receipt :

Proof. exact area1_rank1_upper_warp_trace_checked_boundary_holds. Qed.

(** Rank 4 now has a route-matched machine receipt in addition to its
    generated-source census.  Across the same 2,462-frame zero-A upper-warp
    execution there is one canonical top and one node-1E warp, all 2,353
    top-mesh loads retain the canonical owner and bounded pose, and the warp
    receives no position, collision, or identity store.  The retired top slot
    is reused three times, but each reuse clears collision before installing a
    different behavior and never reloads the top mesh.  This closes relocation
    and collision-preserving cloning on this trace, not universally. *)
Theorem current_rank4_warp_top_trace_receipt :
  Area1Rank4WarpTopTraceCheckedBoundary.
Proof. exact area1_rank4_warp_top_trace_checked_boundary_holds. Qed.

(** Ranks 5 and 5A now share a route-matched intra-frame receipt.  Across
    the same 2,462-frame zero-A execution, every Mario copy is faithful, no
    coordinate or identity store occurs in the post-copy/next-preapply
    window, every cached-platform selection writes null through a checked
    retail store, and every apply/collision boundary remains synchronized.
    The three upper-warp applies at timers 2807--2809 likewise load null with
    inactive time stop.  This closes both mechanisms on this clean execution,
    not across every controller history or behavior outside defined retail
    execution. *)
Theorem current_rank5_state_split_trace_receipt :

Proof. exact area1_rank5_state_split_trace_checked_boundary_holds. Qed.

(** The route-matched replay now watches every raw-Object coordinate store,
    every interaction dispatch/return, the copy index and three readbacks,
    and the cached floor through the final upper-warp query.  All 2,462 copies
    are faithful; the only three post-selection State stores rewrite the
    already occupied height 768.  This is a finite machine receipt, not an
    all-controller-history theorem or a machine-to-Clight bridge. *)

(** Separately, actual Clight memory bounds close the alternate-index read:
    the real US/JP copy first reads velocity at byte 272 if index one is
    selected, but the initialized MarioState global is at most 200 bytes.
    No successful Clight step, including an abstract external, can enlarge
    that old allocation.  This does not exclude skipped/redirected copies on
    another history or assert a result about post-OOB retail continuation. *)

(** Rank 15 no longer needs an injected punching or jump-kick action at its
    accepted local hand-contact boundary.  With A already held, one real B
    edge makes the US retail loop execute idle -> punching -> jump-kick with
    no Mario-state write at release, then Mario catches and rides all six
    positive double-pound steps to Y=-943.  The generated US/JP ASTs retain
    same action chain.  The boss/contact prefix remains staged, so this is a
    stronger primitive rather than a complete no-A route. *)
Theorem current_rank15_controller_ride_boundary :

(** Vertical-speed conservation does not turn the checked local hand ride into
    a tunnel entry with any stock seed considered here.  This source/data
    boundary couples jump-kick to its direct 20-unit velocity replacement,
    checks the 30-unit bounce and 160+78 lookup constants in both generated
    versions, and audits all 176 Area-3 static triangles.  Even granting ideal
    conservation and the full ledge-floor lookup allowance, every integral
    seed through 31 misses the Y=-562 tunnel floor; 32 is merely the first
    purely vertical arithmetic threshold.  The theorem does not prove a live
    wall/XZ trajectory, the staged boss/contact prefix, or the absence of a
    dynamic second support. *)

Proof. exact eyerok_rank15_vsc_boundary_holds. Qed.

(** A literal controller-word search has unbounded waits and continuous
    positions, so Rank 15 now uses a finite source-action quotient instead.
    The executable receipt counts 181,944 combinations of boss edge, two hand
    edges, and candidate Mario effect, then checks the six representatives
    and proves that every raw tuple projects to one of them; an induction
    extends the result across arbitrarily many cycles.  From any entry seed at
    most 31, no schedule represented by the quotient manufactures 32: its only
    fresh top bounce is 30 and the other relevant effects preserve, clear, or
    install 20.  Dynamic support is not silently discarded; it is reduced to
    seven upward hand-action classes whose exact Float32 geometry and ownership
    remain to be searched, while live frames still need refinement into the
    six effect classes. *)
Theorem current_rank15_finite_schedule_search_boundary :
  EyerokRank15ScheduleSearchBoundary.
Proof. exact eyerok_rank15_schedule_search_boundary_holds. Qed.

(** The seven upward hand-action classes left by the finite quotient are now
    absorbed by one deliberately generous two-hand barrier.  The current
    US/JP AST census pins every direct vertical-velocity and gravity write in
    the complete hand-handler family; the collision receipts pin every upward
    Area-3 floor below 384 and the scaled hand top at 507.  Even granting each
    positive episode 288 units, later-hand support on the earlier hand, and an
    additional 630-unit Mario rise, the projected query peaks at 1809 below
    the required 1889.  The verdict is conditional on constructing the named
    memory-faithful selected-Clight hand/list/floor projection; the first live
    step outside the barrier would be an exact counterexample producer. *)
Theorem current_rank15_dynamic_support_boundary :
  EyerokRank15DynamicSupportBoundary.
Proof. exact eyerok_rank15_dynamic_support_boundary_holds. Qed.

(** The accepted Rank-15 bridge now reads both hand slots, their behavior and
    active flags, exact poses/actions/floors, the selected surfaces' owner
    fields, and a real SURFACE-list path directly from CompCert memory.  The
    generated velocity/clamp/position store order proves why a whole connected
    chunk, rather than one envelope transition per micro-step, is necessary.
    Distinct live slots cannot alias any observed cell, and deletion cannot
    resurrect an envelope.  Height comparisons now check the signed-integer
    range before conversion; a regression rejects a negative envelope that
    previously wrapped to +2000.  Every successfully constructed continuous chunk
    run therefore inherits the 1809 < 1889 barrier.  The native boss/hand
    closure is now checked: 157 internal bodies, nine unresolved names, and
    no indirect call inside those bodies.  The generated position-update
    fragment now constructs a connected memory-faithful later-hand chunk
    from real loads, an explicit new-Y comparison and disjoint floor-owner
    reads; its after-projection is no longer assumed.  Other reached chunks,
    the scheduler/prefix, and the exact outside effects remain open. *)

(** Rank 29 no longer has an unidentified direct stock speed source.  The
    selected US/JP initializers authenticate the complete Area-2/Area-3
    roster, and the sleeping-hand branch loads collision while skipping its
    unique attack check.  Starting from the deliberately generous stock cap
    of 110, ordinary air control would require 1,934 uninterrupted updates to
    cross speed 400; the conservative vertical-envelope receipt excludes even
    400 such updates and bounds one settled episode at speed 170.  A complete
    route must therefore expose a repeatable landing/off-floor or moving-floor
    boundary which preserves speed between episodes, or fail one of the
    checked roster/action/alias/outside-call classifications. *)
Theorem current_rank29_stock_preload_boundary :
  EyerokRank29PreloadBoundary.
Proof. exact eyerok_rank29_preload_boundary_holds. Qed.

(** Rank 29's last ordinary stock residual is also closed in the finite
    source-shaped owner model.  All five collision-owning Area-2 platforms
    reload their mesh, platform carry does not touch Mario's forward speed,
    and even a deliberately uncarried stock floor can move at most 78 units
    in one frame, below the strict 100-unit [OFF_FLOOR] test.  The one real
    speed-preserving flat butt-slide-air landing consumes action state zero;
    a second landing cannot repeat it, and re-arming through ground slide
    executes the checked speed-100 normalization.  Area 2 contains no burning
    collision surface for a lava-bounce replacement.  A counterexample must
    now break owner/collision/action/source validity or leave defined stock
    execution rather than merely repeat a normal episode boundary. *)
Theorem current_rank29_stock_cycle_closure :
  EyerokRank29CycleClosure.
Proof. exact eyerok_rank29_cycle_closure_holds. Qed.

(** Mario's movement has several real, finite controls over Eyerok's hand
    state machine.  The 300-unit difference between the boss-relative and
    hand-relative Z gates yields a deterministic TARGET_MARIO selection strip;
    crossing its forward edge releases the chosen hand into a steerable chase.
    The boss gate can hold and release the negative alternating double-pound
    loop, Mario-relative position chooses either sweep sign, and the positive
    sixth-cycle formation clamps Mario's sampled Z to a 1,200-unit band.  The
    same model proves two important limits: position alone cannot force
    FIST_PUSH against both RNG results, and movement does not directly select
    left versus right.  This is a bilateral generated-source and arithmetic
    boundary, not a controller-reachable movie or a target-star route. *)
Theorem current_eyerok_controller_manipulation_boundary :
  EyerokControllerManipulationBoundary.
Proof. exact eyerok_controller_manipulation_boundary_holds. Qed.

(** A paired hash-authenticated US retail suffix now reaches the exact
    controller gates rather than merely modeling them: after the ordinary
    Area-3 boundary, stick input wakes Eyerok, occupies the deterministic
    TARGET_MARIO strip, releases the chase, and produces either sweep sign
    with no A poll, no memory write, and no hand floor/platform ownership.
    The forward-side sample falls from the arena edge at Z=-1889.765; the
    grounded mirror moves chiefly in X but bends backward after its stored
    speed reaches zero.  Source and collision bounds separately leave every
    deterministic target surface behind the warp and the chase top 288 units
    below the tunnel-query threshold.  This closes these two concrete suffixes
    as routes, not every analog schedule or the fixture-assisted prefix. *)

(** Rank 12's strongest named Area-2 impulse actor has no direct payoff.  The
    selected roster has exactly two homing
    Amps and one circling Amp, but none of the cannon, shell, Tweester,
    Heave-Ho, Chuckya, Fly Guy, or jumping-box preset families.  Even granting
    that the nearest homing Amp is perfectly lured to the second-pole top, its
    shock handler contains no push and the shocked action zeroes horizontal
    velocity before the air step; the stock pole grab had already erased
    inherited speed.  Consequently Amp shock supplies no direct horizontal
    dismount. *)

Proof. exact area2_rank12_object_impulse_boundary_holds. Qed.

(** The formerly open stationary-shock wall/support composite is also closed
    in the finite stock source model.  [perform_air_step] applies gravity, so
    the pole-top seed is stationary for one update and lands on the static
    Y=3200 base on update 21.  Radius-50 wall queries miss the aperture walls,
    all six stock moving-owner corridors miss the pole disc, and the scheduler
    clears the cached platform across the 820-unit gap.  A counterexample now
    needs a transported low-tier actor or a concrete failure of the runtime
    owner/corridor projection, not ordinary Amp shock plus stock support. *)

(** Rank 3 can no longer use an ordinary integer-to-pointer cast as a clean
    platform-cell producer: integer constructors never become CompCert block
    pointers, and [Mem.storev] accepts only a block pointer.  The bilateral
    owner-call certificate separately closes the complete syntactically direct
    call graph of all canonical Area-1 surface owners against every named
    pitch-word writer.  Indirect/forged dispatch, lifecycle substitution,
    pre-existing/external aliases, and the six exact unresolved declarations
    remain explicit rather than being claimed impossible here. *)

(** A future machine-level mutation has a now-checked conditional payoff at

    [ACT_LONG_JUMP].  The no-analog binary32 clear-quarter kernel then reaches
    the authenticated target-air cell in five zero-A frames from the pole
    top.  Conversely, granting the same fully initialized action at the
    normalized base contact peaks at only 3440 and misses the target during

(** Rank 16's sole revised top-window timing class is now closed even under a
    deliberately favorable writer oracle.  Generated US/JP syntax fixes
    collision before non-terrain updates, PLAYER list 0 before the Goomba's
    PUSHABLE list 5, Mario action before State-to-Object copying, and the
    Goomba action/attack/movement order.  The exact return-first schedule can
    therefore supply at most 45 rises in the accepted 91-frame interval.  A
    stronger phase-shifted quotient, granted a productive first frame, permits
    46 rises and exact binary32 Y=1017, still 774 below Y=1791.

    This theorem does not prove that either raw-Object writer exists.  It makes
    writer reachability irrelevant to this finite top-window proposal; a
    future Goomba route must instead obtain a longer independent interval or
    a different per-frame state/action effect, then still discharge physical
    PU transport, capture, handoff, and target continuation. *)
