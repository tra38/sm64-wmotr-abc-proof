# Concrete backward experiment from Ink

## Latest: audit the 146 unequal parents and replay their actual suffixes

[The saved-parent diagnostic](../../docs/notes/rank1-parent-mismatch-audit.md)
reproduces all 146 earlier mismatch dictionaries. Every attempt has a Y-record
mismatch; floor height and RNG differ in all 146, while pad/button fields differ
in none. Actual Controller raw-stick/held-button readbacks match on all 3,650
native updates and every A/history check passes.

Each actual suffix continues through its two recorded inputs and 23 retention
updates from one earliest patch, even when its parent differs. None gives the
checked Ink payoff. Forty-seven retain the top at their last Area-1 observation,
where it is still active; all 59 Area-2 arrivals use the ordinary spawn. The
strict search, source ledger and archive are unchanged. This diagnostic does
not merge states, discover a reachable gap or rule out a whole family.

```powershell
& './build/wafel-pilot/python/python.exe' -X utf8 instrumentation/concrete-ink-backward/benchmark_parent_diagnostics.py --ledger build/concrete-ink-backward/20261003-rss-final-report/scattershot.ledger --output build/concrete-ink-backward/NEW-parent-diagnostic
```

The read-only source audit is full-history. Limits are 5,000 native search
updates, 30 seconds each for setup/verification/search, 90 seconds overall
(cooperative), and a hard 100-second child-process ceiling. Search checks time
between complete suffixes; update ceilings check before each advance. No new
proposals are sampled. All 146 replay in 3.164 external process seconds,
including preparation, verification and receipt/exit costs. Eighty-five code
tests pass. See `expected-parent-diagnostics.json` for the compact, shared
per-trial receipt; a new output directory is required. The full local run is
`build/concrete-ink-backward/20261003-rss-parent-delivery/`.

## Earlier: compact storage and a bounded Reverse Scattershot pilot

[The checked pilot](../../docs/notes/rank1-reverse-scattershot-pilot.md) stops at
2,000 native search updates per arm, including suffix and retention replay.
Reverse Scattershot completes 292 distinct combinations: 74 selected conditional
passes, 218 rejections and a separately recorded final incomplete attempt.
All 146 earlier-step proposals fail their parent checkpoint; real Ink depth
remains one. The archive has twelve entries, six recipes and twelve suffixes.
No gap producer, route exclusion or new Coq result follows. All 78 code tests
and a real 8+8-versus-16 deterministic resume control pass. No long search runs.

New storage uses compact case/recipe/controller IDs, accepted-ID references and
independently compressed bounded chunks. Actual 80,000-row migration reduces
50.1 MB of old payload to a 0.733 MB whole ledger; full compact audit takes
6.19 s. Default full resume still hashes and validates every committed record.
Explicit latest mode trusts older payloads and says so; `--audit` always uses
full verification. Read-only compatibility supports v1/v2 logs. To migrate v2,
run `benchmark_compaction.py --source OLD.ledger --output NEW --cases COUNT`;
the destination must be new and the source is preserved. Changed source/config
fingerprints refuse incompatible resume.

`--setup-seconds`, `--verification-seconds`, `--search-seconds` and optional
`--wall-seconds` separate budgets. Product `--seconds` aliases search work only.
Time bounds are cooperative; safe checkpoint/close can exceed them. Verification
incomplete runs zero candidates and preserves committed history. Native
`--game-updates` checks before each advance and records a partial candidate as
incomplete, without consuming its sampling ticket. Receipts give all phases;
external benchmarks also include process startup/receipt writing/final exit.

The seeded scheduler alternates fresh samples and backward extensions, reserving
shorter branches while preferring deeper ones. Seven button classes and nine
stick regions partition the gated encoded alphabet. Coarse buckets never merge
states. Disk archives pin exact reconstruction recipes and all inputs; native
full snapshots stay in memory. Each extension patches only its earliest state
and continuously checks all parent observations, the within-update movement
event, top retention and first Area-2 displacement. Raw/display words at the
accepted return still use the explicit conditional prefix frame; they are not
independently observed per sampled input by Wafel. Original/Variant/Hybrid
requirements remain separate even when one exact execution is shared.

```powershell
& './build/wafel-pilot/python/python.exe' -X utf8 instrumentation/concrete-ink-backward/reverse_scattershot.py --seed 20261003 --game-updates 2000 --trials 2000 --depth 3 --archive 12 --setup-seconds 30 --verification-seconds 30 --search-seconds 30 --wall-seconds 90 --output build/concrete-ink-backward/NEW-pilot/report.json
& './build/wafel-pilot/python/python.exe' -X utf8 instrumentation/concrete-ink-backward/reverse_scattershot.py --resume --seed 20261003 --game-updates 2000 --trials 2000 --depth 3 --archive 12 --output build/concrete-ink-backward/NEW-pilot/report.json
& './build/wafel-pilot/python/python.exe' -X utf8 instrumentation/concrete-ink-backward/reverse_scattershot.py --audit --output build/concrete-ink-backward/NEW-pilot/report.json
```

See `expected-reverse-scattershot-pilot.json` for the fixed-budget comparison,
storage costs, hashes and archive. Ground, freefall and final-message inverses
are implemented; horizontal/support/rotation and other action/writer inverses
are absent. More sampling cannot cover missing generators. All scene poses
remain supplied conditional states, not controller-reached gameplay witnesses.

## Earlier: an individual, resumable one-update counter

**Checkpoint repair, 3 October:** [the bounded chunk ledger](../../docs/notes/rank1-chunk-ledger.md)
now commits trial data, accepted predecessor recipes, counts and sampling
cursor together. The old 2.9-day extrapolation is withdrawn. A separate real
80,000-case growth benchmark measures 93.315 seconds across three complete
batch processes, or 99.801 seconds including three extra full audits; peak
game-process memory stays near 968 MiB and logs grow to 47.86 MiB. There are
62 passing search/recovery/pilot tests. No gap producer or Coq result follows.

`product_sweep.py` tests all three target menus with a cached, fully restored
scene for each actual Wafel update. `--buttons stock-gameplay` gates L and the
four D-pad bits at the user's request, retaining B/Z/Start/R/all C buttons and
all 65,536 stick pairs. The selected product has 335,544,320 menu/input cases
per fixed A mode. This does not assert those excluded buttons are formally
equivalent in every history. Legacy full-button options remain available.

The [stopped 5,000-trial check](../../docs/notes/rank1-gated-input-batch.md)
passes 1,750 selected-field comparisons and rejects 3,250. It uses two resumed
2,500-case batches, with 3.7233 seconds of timed trials. All 45 code tests pass.
No whole-update input grouping, gameplay gap producer or full-state match
is established. `rejected-event` may fit another installation height; it is
not a whole-Ink exclusion. The exact accepted-return observer and Area-2
suffix checks remain separate from per-trial matching.

```powershell
& './build/wafel-pilot/python/python.exe' -X utf8 instrumentation/concrete-ink-backward/product_sweep.py --buttons stock-gameplay --order mixed --cases 2500 --seconds 30 --output build/concrete-ink-backward/NEW-chunk-counter/report.json
& './build/wafel-pilot/python/python.exe' -X utf8 instrumentation/concrete-ink-backward/product_sweep.py --buttons stock-gameplay --order mixed --resume --cases 2500 --seconds 30 --output build/concrete-ink-backward/NEW-chunk-counter/report.json
& './build/wafel-pilot/python/python.exe' -X utf8 instrumentation/concrete-ink-backward/product_sweep.py --audit --output build/concrete-ink-backward/NEW-chunk-counter/report.json
```

`--cases` and `--seconds` bound each invocation; `--seconds` now limits search
work separately from setup and validation. `--order mixed` is an exact permutation; no untested
input representative is counted. The adjacent `.ledger/` contains bounded
immutable chunks and a checksummed HEAD, the authority for counts/cursor.
The report is not authoritative and can be reconstructed after interruption.
Default `--resume-verify full` streams/hashes all committed trial and retained
bytes, verifies enumeration/chain/counts and reports the cost in the verification phase.
Checkpoint writing never rereads old payloads. Full resume remains linear in
history per invocation, so repeatedly auditing growing prefixes is expensive.

Explicit `--resume-verify latest` verifies only the latest chunk and prior
metadata; its receipt warns that historical contents are not verified. Run
normal full resume or `--audit` for old-chunk corruption detection. Failed
append/checkpoint data is preserved in `recovery/`; only committed IDs count,
and uncommitted work may be replayed. Retained files are accepted predecessor
recipes, not portable save-state dumps. Source/runtime, input/action history,
enumeration and chunk-setting differences refuse resume. Legacy v1 JSONL is
preserved and supported by read-only `--audit`, without silent migration.
`--benchmark` is a timing sample and cannot resume this coverage stream.
The compact `expected-gated-product.json` records the stopped result.
The original 5,000-case dataset and separate 80,000-case benchmark are both
stopped; no continuation is running. See `expected-chunk-ledger-benchmark.json`
for inclusive timing, memory/log growth and explicit integrity limits.

The [implemented move inventory](../../docs/notes/rank1-concrete-move-inventory.md)
lists both installation setups and the three earlier action families. Its
original default-mode enumeration checks 252/216 installation proposals and 1,260 earlier
proposals per parent. Every earlier proposal inherits collision position and
keeps movement X/Z fixed; no horizontal or moving-support inverse exists yet.
This inventory is not a new gameplay search or broader coverage result.

## Controller options

Both installation and earlier generators now accept the following options:

| Switch | Default | Other mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--sticks` | `sampled`: nine raw stick poses | `encoded`: all 65,536 signed-byte pairs |
| `--buttons` | `bz`: four B/Z combinations | `all-non-a`: all 8,192 combinations of B, Z, Start, L, R, C buttons and D-pad |
| `--a-mode` | `released` | `held`: real preparation press before the searched contexts, then hold without a new edge |

The full product has 536,870,912 choices per pose and is generated lazily.
The old 36 controls come first; wider modes then try all pose templates for
each remaining input. Candidate/time limits still apply, so the configured
alphabet need not be exhausted. Reserved bits 6/7 are excluded. Raw encoding
coverage is not physical-controller realizability or gameplay-history coverage.

Held mode does not patch button history: it makes one real preparation press
at frame 361, verifies A is already down in every searched context, and
rejects a release or new A-pressed flag during every continuously replayed
suffix. This is not an A-never-pressed route. No release/repress mode is added.

Thirty-eight real Wafel input probes and 37 application tests pass. The
default released-A and held-A one-update low-display menus each test 216
proposals and match 36. Wider one-update smoke tests exercise the switches
but stop at candidate limits. See the [checked input-options note](../../docs/notes/rank1-encoded-controller-options.md)
and `expected-input-options.json` for exact scope, timings and source hashes.
This adds input choices to the same five move families; it does not discover
a gap producer or complete an exhaustive one-second search.

```powershell
& './build/wafel-pilot/python/python.exe' instrumentation/concrete-ink-backward/search.py --target low-display --depth 1 --sticks encoded --buttons all-non-a --a-mode held --candidates 240 --seconds 30 --output build/concrete-ink-backward/20261003-input-options/encoded-all-held.json
& './build/wafel-pilot/python/python.exe' instrumentation/concrete-ink-backward/input_options_check.py --output build/concrete-ink-backward/20261003-input-options/runtime.json
```

The 3 October variant-only mode uses `--target low-display`. It requires
movement Y=1861 at the action-entry checkpoint with collision/display Y=768
and a supplied depth-zero setup. Its thirty-update horizon checks 1,476
proposals in 9.947622 seconds, keeps one last-update pose and empties at depth
two. All 1,260 sampled earlier moves fail. The final-dialog near match copies
collision Y to 1861. See [the follow-up note](../../docs/notes/rank1-low-display-backward.md)
and `expected-low-display-result.json`; the earlier measurements below are
preserved separately. The current fifteen search tests and fifteen original
pilot tests pass. No thirty-edge chain or gameplay producer is claimed.

The separate `dialog_continuation.py` check advances the supplied neutral
final-dialog near match for 24 updates from one patch. It confirms no warp or
Area-2 entry: dialog blocks interaction, then collision Y=1861 is above the
upper warp's Y=768..818 hitbox, and the next update refreshes display as well.
`expected-dialog-continuation.json` records that finite check; it is not a new
backward search, gameplay witness or Coq exclusion.

"Dialog" here is the automatic milestone-message action, supplied at action
state 24 before its final update. The candidate already has movement Y=1861,
collision/display Y=768 and depth zero. No star pickup or opened message is
used to construct it; that predecessor's gameplay validity remains conditional.

This separate prototype extends Dot's concrete Wafel loop to a real Ink
target. It does not change the symbolic search or the freefall pilot. The
first backward move proposes a low collision record and candidate display from
the accepted-warp relationship. The full game validates the candidate.
Earlier inverse moves propose ordinary ground copy/sinking, four freefall
quarters, and the final automatic-dialog update. The game decides floor
queries, collisions, cancellation, clamps and every callback.

The target is successful upper-warp acceptance inside the update, followed by
capture and retention of the original top and the first Area-2 displacement.
Wafel's action log exposes movement at disappeared-action entry. The separate
emulator observer reads **all nine position words at the accepted return**, before
the action executes, and watches the true first Area-2 apply. Three named
controls pass: supplied movement Y=768 and Y=1861 with collision Y=768 and
display Y=1938.8648681640625, plus movement Y=1861 with both collision and
display Y=768. The last works at depth zero: its first query finds the top,
then disappeared-action alignment, copying and capture retain it. No raised
display is needed in this supplied variant. Its 1,093-unit movement/collision
split still needs a gameplay producer.

## Measured result, 2 October 2026

The 30-update horizon's finite tree empties at depth two. Of 252 last-update
proposals, 216 reproduce the selected installation/capture fields, grouped
into six retained pose cases; 36 fail. All 7,560 earlier proposals fail to reproduce those parents. Search
takes 50.9505891 seconds; preparation and controls bring the run to 52.0510664
seconds. Median trial time is 5.97185 milliseconds. **Only one backward update
is validated; no thirty-edge chain was obtained.** This prices this pruned
finite tree, not exhaustive one-second coverage or a larger-horizon search.
Six additional neutral controls replay the retained pose cases through Area 2
from one initial patch, with no intermediate state operations; all reproduce
the displacement. Those controls are outside the timed search. Other input
variants are not proved equivalent in omitted state.

## Conditions and limitations

The full scene contexts come from normally initialized SSL after supplied
four-pillar completion and neutral updates to timer 131. Mario is unmounted.
Pose, vertical speed, action fields and selected depth values are
conditional patches. No action constructor, negative seed, valid reward
contact or route to these patches is proved. The original context's omitted
state is supplied, not independently compared.

Parent equality compares movement, collision, display, action and depth.
The final comparison additionally checks action argument, used warp, floor
height/owner and captured platform, plus movement at action entry. Other
observed fields support restore checks but are not suffix equality claims.
Each extended trial restores its earliest full context, patches once, and
advances continuously. It stops on a mismatching checkpoint and restores the
caller; it never patches or restores an intermediate state.

The original measured finite move menu samples seven last-update poses across six heights,
including the low-display Y=1861 variant, five freefall speeds, three ground
heights, selected depth values, and 36 released-A input
representatives (neutral/B/Z/B+Z with nine stick directions). It does not
enumerate all binary32 values, controller samples, action histories, moving
support, late writers or other scene contexts. A beam limit can discard
additional distinct parents; none were discarded in the checked run. Empty
frontier means **nothing survives this menu in these contexts**, not that Ink
or these entire gameplay mechanisms are impossible. No Coq result is claimed.

## Commands

Use the installed Windows x64 Python 3.9.13 / Wafel 0.8.5 runtime for the DLL:

```powershell
& './build/wafel-pilot/python/python.exe' instrumentation/concrete-ink-backward/search.py --depth 30 --candidates 9000 --seconds 90 --beam 6 --output build/concrete-ink-backward/20261002-expanded/report.json
& './build/wafel-pilot/python/python.exe' instrumentation/concrete-ink-backward/search.py --target low-display --depth 30 --candidates 9000 --seconds 90 --beam 6 --output build/concrete-ink-backward/20261003-low-display/report.json
& './build/wafel-pilot/python/python.exe' instrumentation/concrete-ink-backward/dialog_continuation.py --output build/concrete-ink-backward/20261003-low-display/dialog-continuation.json
& './build/wafel-pilot/python/python.exe' -m unittest discover -s instrumentation/concrete-ink-backward -p 'test_*.py' -v
```

Use Ubuntu-24.04's existing Mupen64Plus 2.5.9 pure interpreter for the exact
checkpoint controls. The runner authenticates the ROM and instruction ranges,
compiles with warnings as errors and imposes a 90-second emulator limit:

```sh
bash instrumentation/concrete-ink-backward/capture.sh /path/to/baserom.jp.z64 768
bash instrumentation/concrete-ink-backward/capture.sh /path/to/baserom.jp.z64 1861
bash instrumentation/concrete-ink-backward/capture.sh /path/to/baserom.jp.z64 1861 low
```

Twelve new bookkeeping, inverse-map and receipt controls pass. The original
fifteen pilot tests still pass. The test backend is not a game model.
`expected-result.json` preserves the compact measured receipt and hashes.
Full reports and emulator logs remain in ignored build output; no ROM, DLL,
save state, conversation export or credentials are published. See
[the experiment note](../../docs/notes/rank1-concrete-ink-backward.md).
