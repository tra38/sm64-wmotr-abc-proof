# JP Timer-131 lifecycle and protected-memory receipt

This fixture starts from the project's accepted level-select endpoint and
tests the route-relevant spinning-top prefix.  It writes `4` only to the
pyramid top's pillar-counter word in object-pool slot 61, then lets the
hash-authenticated original-JP game run normally until the top reaches action
1, timer 131.  The write is logged separately at `0x803452ec`; it is disjoint
from Mario's slot 67 and every protected range.

The probe arms CPU write watchpoints for both Mario pointers, Mario's list
links, active halfword, behavior, `oFlags`, graphical Y offset, the list-0
sentinel links, all 14 `bhvMario` words, and all 56 behavior-dispatch entries.
It also counts the three Mario callbacks, allocation and unload functions,
the two sound functions, the two print callees, and the two debug-specific
print call instructions.  `run.sh` rejects any changed endpoint line or any
missing, extra, reordered, or altered watched write.

Run the canonical receipt with:

```sh
bash instrumentation/jp-lifecycle/run.sh /path/to/baserom.jp.z64
```

The accepted interval is global timer 348 through 492.  It contains 145
poll-boundary samples and 144 complete updates.  Every update produces exactly
one watched event: `sh $zero, 0x76(object)` at `0x802c88c4`.  That halfword is
immediately after, and does not overlap, the protected `activeFlags` halfword
at offset `0x74`.  At action 1 timer 131, Mario is still slot 67, both Mario
pointers agree, the one-node player-list ring and `bhvMario` persist,
`oFlags=0x100`, the graphical offset is zero, and both command-array hashes
are unchanged.

The interval executes each Mario callback 144 times, enters allocation 93
times, unloads 71 objects, and reaches `stop_sounds_from_source` 71 times,
without allocator fallback or a protected write.  The separate retail-MIPS
certificate gives the sound routine an all-path object-pool frame and proves
`sqrtf` store-free.  HUD rendering reaches `print_text` 864 times and
`print_text_fmt_int` 432 times; the watched receipt covers those machine calls.
The two conservative debug callsites at `0x802c99dc` and `0x802c9a08` have
zero hits, and their authentic JAL words decode to the recorded print callees.

This is a conditional execution receipt, not a clean four-pillar witness or a
universal theorem over all controller histories.  It also relies on the
debugger's CPU-watchpoint behavior rather than a formal semantics of the whole
N64.  Its valid conclusion is precise: no corruption producer occurs in this
selected route-specific machine timeline.  Universal exclusion still needs
all-history protected-step coverage (or the CompCert
`InkTimer131ReachableStepCoverage` theorem) and a machine-step refinement of
watchpoint completeness.

## Record the conditional Ink arrival

The later part of this existing fixture supplies the three Mario positions
once, at top timer 131, and clears the remembered platform. The game itself
then selects and retains the top, enters Area 2 and applies the displacement.
This is a supplied test setup, not controller-reachable installation. No
Area-2 position or camera is supplied by the fixture.

In Ubuntu-24.04, from the active SSL project directory:

```sh
LIFECYCLE_CAPTURE_FROM=360 bash instrumentation/jp-lifecycle/run.sh /path/to/baserom.jp.z64
bash instrumentation/jp-lifecycle/render-video.sh /path/to/printed/video.XXXXXX
```

The recording option creates a fresh `build/instrumentation/jp-lifecycle/video.*`
directory, including isolated configuration and saves. It captures all 521
rendered frames from 360 through 880, disables on-screen screenshot notices,
runs the unchanged receipt checks, rejects a missing frame, and encodes a
silent 30-fps raw video. The input plugin and controller policy are unchanged.
It requires the existing emulator/plugins, development headers, Xvfb, FFmpeg
and FFprobe; rendering captions additionally uses DejaVu Sans.

`render-video.sh` checks the recorded arrival, landing and zero-A outcome,
then produces a labeled full recording and an 8.73-second half-speed
highlight. The highlight uses consecutive source frames 480 through 610;
there are no cuts inside that interval. Captions occupy added black margins,
not the game image. The exact initial arrival is partly obscured by the
ordinary game camera, so its coordinates come from the accompanying trace.

The [arrival report](../../docs/notes/ink-area2-arrival-video.md) contains the
checked-in highlight, exact results and hashes. Full video, screenshots, save
files and raw logs remain in the ignored build directory; no ROM is included.
