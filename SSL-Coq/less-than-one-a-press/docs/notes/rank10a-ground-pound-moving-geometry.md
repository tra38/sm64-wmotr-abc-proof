# Rank 10A: ground-pound startup and moving geometry

## Result

**Open, but no longer an untested height idea.** A granted ground-pound
startup over a steadily descending elevator has a real height window:
Mario can end 260 units above its floor, exceeding the checked 231-unit
lower-wall-query cutoff. This is not a clean entry, sideways crossing or
star collection. Startup stops sideways speed, and the earlier wall/floor
queries still run. The simplest entry proposal also fails: following a floor
that descends ten units cannot create the more-than-100-unit gap that turns
grounded motion into freefall.

This work concerns ordinary gameplay, including glitches. It uses source
inspection, Coq and offline arithmetic. There were no game-state edits and
no new emulator run or controller-input route in this tranche.

## Source and proof

The [Coq module](../../proofs/Area2Rank10AGroundPound.v) resolves five real
bodies in both selected programs: ground pound, freefall, the speed setter,
the geometry-input update and the elevator. Its startup-prefix receipt
couples the actual timer calculation, headroom comparison, Mario Y store,
downward-speed assignment and zero-speed call. It executes the actual
post-headroom Y-store fragment in selected Clight memory and proves that
this store preserves Mario's X and Z cells. This is a local execution,
not a complete frame or a proof that the entry is reachable.

The ten attempted lifts are `20,18,16,14,12,10,8,6,4,2`. Each requires the
rounded `Y + lift + 160` to be strictly below the queried ceiling. Coq permits
every pass/fail pattern and bounds actual binary32 height by the integer
entry ceiling plus 110, including finite fractional starting heights in the
documented ordinary-coordinate range. It does not assume translation-invariant
rounding. Restarting the action or adding a support displacement, collision
correction or other position effect requires a new accounting; those steps
are not part of this non-wrapping, startup-only recurrence.

The 110-unit gain is exact for the integer-aligned timing test below. For a
fractional entry the theorem uses its integer upper bound: it does not claim
an exact 110-unit gain from every fractional starting value. The diagnostic
includes the rounding control `4095.999755859375 -> 4206`, whose gain is very
slightly larger than 110 but still obeys the proved ceiling-plus-110 bound.

## The elevator-relative window

The normal animation descriptor has `loopEnd = 11`. The action advances to
falling when its incremented timer reaches `loopEnd + 4`: fifteen startup
updates, not just the ten that raise Mario. The flying-entry descriptor has
`loopEnd = 16`, giving twenty updates, but ordinary freefall requests argument
zero and cannot select that longer variant simply by waiting. The
[offline checker](../../instrumentation/rank10a-ground-pound/check.js) verifies
both pinned asset descriptors. Their **live loading and persistence are not
proved by the Clight theorem**; the finite timing scenario supplies the
normal duration.

Grant both positions at Y=4966 immediately before the first modeled terrain
update, ten units of elevator descent before every Mario update, full
headroom and no other position effect. The exact Float32 results are:

| Point in this granted scenario | Mario's rise | Elevator descent | Relative height |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| After startup update 10 | 110 | 100 | 210 |
| After update 12 | 110 | 120 | 230 |
| After update 13 | 110 | 130 | 240 |
| After update 15 | 110 | 150 | 260 |
| First falling update, quarters 1–4 | decreasing | 160 | 257.5, 245, 232.5, 220 |

The last row grants continuation through the four air-step quarters; real
collisions may stop them earlier. Both absolute-world and relative Float32
calculations are checked. The table does not authenticate a ground-pound
state at Y=4966: that entry is deliberately being granted for the test.
The cutoff measures a wall query, not a sufficient rim landing or star
collection condition.

## Why height alone is insufficient

Startup sets vertical speed to -50 and calls the normal speed setter with
zero. The source multiplication receipt and finite-Float32 theorem show that
negative sine/cosine values yield signed zero, not hidden sideways speed.
The startup branch has no ordinary air step, action setter or B/Z cancel.
The falling branch also omits ordinary stick-controlled air steering. Its
air-step argument is zero, disabling the optional ledge-grab and ceiling-hang
checks.

Skipping that action-level air step is **not collision immunity**. The earlier
geometry-input update still performs two wall queries and then a floor query
before its first branch. Moving geometry may matter through those queries,
the platform update, an interaction or resumed falling collisions. The
Y-store's X/Z frame does not cover those other operations or the startup's
sound/animation/copy calls. A falling ground pound can also change to backward
air knockback after a wall hit. The bounded test below excludes a direct
outward launch from an ordinary inner-face hit, not every collision-dependent
departure; this is not a B/Z cancel.

## Bounded falling-wall departure check

The ordinary inner-wall hit does **not** provide an outward launch through
the same elevator face. The source-mesh diagnostic extracts all eight inner
wall triangles, checks their four inward cardinal normals, and enumerates
all 65,536 facing angles for each. The wall-hit test accepts 16,383 angles
per face. In all 65,532 accepted cases, the ground pound's new backward
speed points strictly inward relative to that face. Tangential motion can
remain, but the new velocity does not propel Mario through the wall he hit.

This checks the signed-16 yaw comparison and pinned Float32 trigonometric
values used by the normal speed setter, not a new Coq theorem or a live
trajectory. The generated US `mario_step` body also contains the signed-short
comparison against 24,576. The no-floor and low-ceiling returns can report
the same wall-hit result without that facing test; they are **not** excluded.
Neither are corner/multiple-wall histories, another selected surface, prior
collision corrections, or later collisions after the inward launch. A useful
departure now needs one of those concrete additions rather than merely the
ordinary same-face hit. The eligible ground-pound entry remains missing.

## Eligible predecessors

The generated airborne-source census has twelve direct requesters: jump,
double jump, triple jump, backflip, freefall, held-object jump, held-object
freefall, side flip, wall kick, flying, flying triple jump and special triple
jump. The automatic-action census adds start-hanging, hanging and moving on
a hanging ceiling. These are callsite facts, not proof of useful no-A entry.

Forward/backward rollout, jump-kick, dive and the initial upper-entry fall
have no direct ground-pound request. Finishing a rollout animation changes
its substate, not its action to ordinary freefall. Neither Z at the rollout
apex nor adding 110 to the rollout maximum constructs a composite. Ordinary
freefall accepts Z, with B taking priority if both inputs are present.

For every one-unit height bin in the ordinary range, Coq proves the actual
Float32 `Y > (Y + (-10)) + 100` test false, including fractional Y. If the
real query keeps returning the intact elevator base and grounded movement
reanchors every frame, descent alone cannot produce `OFF_FLOOR`. Different
floors, skipped reanchors, outside pushes and already-airborne predecessors
are different cases, not excluded gameplay glitches. The [entry follow-up](rank10a-elevator-entry-checks.md)
now checks the complete nominal cycle, including the start/stop jolts, and
executes the actual floor-distance guard under one-unit agreement with the
same base. It also finds no stock hangable ceiling above the bucket. Live
timing, selected-surface agreement and ceiling freshness remain explicit
obligations; the local checks are not a complete gameplay execution.

## Height alone cannot replace departure (2026-09-10)

The [shared contact-readback proof](rank12b-cross-barrier-contact.md#same-call-memory-connection-2026-09-10)
now starts with the actual object readings and follows a complete US/JP
contact call. With the normal target positions and radii, every finite X/Z
inside the stock elevator footprint misses every required secret and settled
target star, regardless of Mario's Y, provided the reached distance calculation
returns the ordinary square-root result. The horizontal miss occurs before
the function reads either hitbox height.

This strengthens the reason to search for a useful sideways departure:
ground-pound startup's height window cannot by itself collect a target from
inside the unchanged footprint. It does **not** prove that Mario's collision
Object stays there. His movement record, display record and collision Object
must not be conflated; moving geometry, an interaction or a later copy can
change what the contact call actually reads. Those histories and the clean
ground-pound entry remain open. No new controller trajectory is claimed.

## Remaining useful searches

1. Find a controller-reachable eligible predecessor at the actual gate.
   Identify the first genuine freefall or other cancellable action instead
   of supplying a ground-pound state.
2. Pair startup with one real sideways effect: a moving wall, a selected
   rotating/translating support, an interaction, or a precise falling-wall
   response. Fix its order relative to the pre-action queries.
3. Follow every query, interruption, landing and star suffix in one run.
   A hanging version must establish the hangable ceiling and an allowed
   held-A history, not a fresh A edge.

Other Area-2 movers remain separate: the vertically cycling Grindel, rolling
Spindel, horizontal Grindels and moving walls do not obey the elevator's
pure-vertical, same-floor model. Their displacement, support choice and
contact timing need checking. A stationary support gives no descent bonus,
and a frozen elevator cannot be credited with movement on skipped updates.

Rank 10A therefore remains **low promise**. There is a genuine conditional
height window, but no clean eligible entry plus useful departure. Search
for those missing operations rather than repeating the height arithmetic.

## Reproduction

Run `node instrumentation/rank10a-ground-pound/check.js` from the active SSL
project. It checks both descriptors, all 1,024 normal-startup headroom masks,
absolute-world falling samples, signed-zero controls and 128,004 numeric
floor-following samples. These diagnostics supplement the Coq induction and
selected-source/store proofs. `check-rank10a` rebuilds the imported capstone
and audits its focused theorem assumptions.

The 2026-09-05 wall-response follow-up also passes all 262,144 side/facing
tests: all 65,532 accepted ordinary hits point inward, with minimum inward
speed `11.313708305358887`. The existing diagnostic controls still pass.
This follow-up changes no Coq code and makes no new live-execution claim.

Validation passed: the bounded module compile, integrated SSL build, no-hole
and link-hygiene checks, all twelve focused/capstone assumption audits, and
the offline diagnostic. The atlas retains all 45 navigation anchors and
single-paragraph Rank 10A sections. The repository-wide discipline script
still reports its pre-existing missing `sm64-proof` switch; these successful
checks use the active SSL `sm64-item-proof` toolchain, not that broken setting.
