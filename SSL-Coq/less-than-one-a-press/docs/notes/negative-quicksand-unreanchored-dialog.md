# Negative quicksand plus an unreanchored action

## Verdict

This is a real conditional Graphics-gap mechanism, but the generated
defined-producer search has found no clean zero-A source for its negative
starting depth.  The bilateral audit now classifies all 18 direct depth stores
in each game version, closes source-created Mario-state and landing-descriptor
aliases, and retains only the late long-jump landing subtraction as a
potentially negative ordinary write; its stock provenance requires A.  The
route is therefore closed at the checked source-producer boundary, but not yet
as a theorem about every live Clight execution or about retail hardware. The
new backward execution cuts prove the actual landing write needs timer four
or later and the ordinary launch guard skips without the A-pressed bit; the
live connections between those checkpoints remain open.

Execution-scope note: the two remaining semantic inputs are (1) a projection
of every reached internal Clight step to one of the checked source cases and
(2) exact byte frames or implementations for every reached genuine
`EF_external` call.  CompCert deliberately leaves those external effects
abstract, so their C prototypes cannot supply the missing frame.  Invalid/OOB
writes, ACE, DMA, and post-undefined-behavior machine continuations have no
successful Clight step and remain separate MIPS/hardware work.  See [the
project execution-scope boundary](../compcert-execution-scope.md).

1. the checked source transition kernel cannot first acquire either
   long-jump action without an A edge or a forged-state event;
2. in the finite fresh-star lifecycle model, collision eligibility follows an
   unstopped Mario update, and the modeled post-timer-4 case preserves the
   attack by producing the timer-5 `-2.65f` payload; and
3. in the finite untransported-dialog model, sinks raise Graphics Y without
   moving the supplied raw Mario X/Z from the boundary near `(5760,4899.19)`
   to the fixed upper warp at `(-2048,-1024)`.

The three reachability possibilities now have different statuses:

| Possibility | Current result |
|---|---|
| A long-jump/landing prehistory with no A edge | Excluded in the finite source-shaped kernel.  The only recognized ordinary long-jump constructor is guarded by `INPUT_A_PRESSED`, and landing is produced only from long jump.  Connecting every reached Clight step to that kernel remains explicit. |
| A forged action, timer, descriptor, callback, input, or state identity | No concrete clean writer survived the generated-source audit.  There is no untyped/interior derivation, whole-state/descriptor copy, stored or returned pointer of either protected type, or retained descriptor address; the only retained Mario-state initializer alias is the intended base pointer.  The initialized interaction callback and writable action tables are also closed.  A live typed step outside the checked projection or a specified external effect remains the exact in-model escape. |
| Starting the modeled clean interval in the injected state | Excluded at the stated boundaries: the abstract pyramid contract fixes action `0x1932`; a separate concrete memory postcondition assumes/fixes timer zero and depth `+0.0f`.  The ordinary Area-1 entry memory postcondition separately fixes action `0x1924`, timer zero, and depth `+0.0f`. |

The remaining ordinary-gameplay search needs linked-step classification, or
one concrete allowed game step outside the current classification.
The star/dialog/PU analysis remains useful as a characterization of what that
payload would do, but it is not evidence that ordinary zero-A play can create
the payload.

Ordinary Parallel-Universe movement does not change this finite-kernel result.
Signed-16 collision aliasing can select remote surfaces and platform
displacement can change positions, but neither mechanism is an ordinary
constructor of Mario's action/timer or a writer of the landing descriptor.
A PU would become relevant to *creating* the payload only if it also enabled a
concrete valid aliased write into one of those control cells; no such in-model
writer is currently known.  An OOB producer is a separate machine-semantics
branch rather than an open successful Clight store.

The bounded forgery and writable-table audits make that residual more precise.  All nine landing descriptors, `sInteractionHandlers`, and the two knockback-action tables are writable globals, but the bilateral generated programs contain no direct assignment to them.  Each landing-descriptor address appears only in its matching wrapper; the strengthened action-table audit proves that the handler and knockback names occur only in four terminal loads per version, never in an assignment address, return, call argument, public export, or owning-unit initializer relocation.  The three action tables occupy exactly `320` writable bytes, yet ordinary controller operations write zero bytes and merely select bounded reads.  This is not because a mutation would be harmless: one four-byte knockback entry can encode any 32-bit action, including `ACT_LONG_JUMP`, and one compatible handler-pointer word can redirect the coin or pole row to another stock automatic handler; a two-word handler-plus-knockback construction can conditionally request long jump.  The completed proof constructs the private table relation from the selected linked initial memory, classifies every actual reached Clight constructor and all four terminal reads, and carries the table-byte frame through every finite successful in-bounds selected run, so this conditional payload has no in-model producer.  Corrupting only the action timer is also insufficient for a four-frame landing because the preincrement cancel returns before timer 4 or 5 reaches the body, and the landing function-pointer call remains below `m->input & INPUT_A_PRESSED`.  The 29 initialized handlers, 23 direct action literals, four local selectors, Snufit's 18 bounded entries, and Bully's five outcomes are all non-target.  Changing Mario's action separately still requires a same-block byte-overlapping store.  See the [writable action-table audit](writable-action-table-mutation.md).  N64 flat-address OOB behavior remains deferred to a machine model.

A fresh star with compatible vertical placement, an older pre-positioned
tangible star, a forged long-jump state, live dialog platform transport, warp
relocation/substitution, collision aliasing, or an unclassified raw-coordinate
writer remains outside this reduction.

## Defined-producer close-out

`NegativeDepthDefinedProducerClosure.v` connects the existing whole-corpus
writer census to the exact generated right-hand-side shapes.  The following
counts and results hold independently for US and JP:

| Routine | Direct depth stores | Checked form and sign result |
|---|---:|---|
| `init_mario` | 1 | Reset to zero. |
| `check_common_airborne_cancels` | 1 | Reset to zero. |
| `mario_execute_automatic_action` | 1 | Reset to zero. |
| `act_quicksand_death` | 1 | Add positive `5.0f`. |
| `common_landing_action` | 1 | Add `(4 - timer) * 3.5f - 0.5f`; non-long landings reach only safe timers 1–3, while the dangerous late timers require long-jump provenance. |
| `quicksand_jump_land_action` | 2 | Subtract the timer expression and immediately clamp the result to at least `1.1f`. |
| `mario_execute_submerged_action` | 1 | Reset to zero. |
| `mario_update_quicksand` | 10 | Reset/minimum, four positive-speed additions, and positive caps at `10`, `25`, and `60`. |

The companion type-directed census checks all 38 selected generated units.  It
finds no untyped or interior derivation involving `MarioState *` or
`LandingAction *`, no whole-structure copy, no runtime storage or return of
either pointer type, exactly one initializer-held Mario-state alias at offset
zero (`gMarioState = &gMarioStates[0]`), and no initializer-held landing
descriptor address.  The only two indirect calls receiving `MarioState *` are
the A-guarded landing callback and the already-closed interaction dispatcher.
These results close a source-created hidden alias; they do not assume that an
arbitrary external implementation leaves public writable globals alone.

The remaining external-frame interface is exact rather than declaration-wide.
It protects Mario's input/flags, action, action state, timer, argument and
depth bytes, the live `gMarioState` pointer cell, and all 28 bytes of each of
the nine landing descriptors.  Both generated `mario_misc` units export
`gMarioStates` and `gMarioState`, so the private-symbol argument that protects
the action tables cannot simply be reused for these cells.  Recognized CompCert
builtins and runtime helpers preserve the bytes because their modeled calls
leave memory unchanged.  A genuine unresolved `EF_external` must instead be
proved unreachable, supplied with this frame, or refined to an implementation
whose stores can be checked.  Likewise, the live-step bridge must show that
each reached typed internal store is one of the safe cases above and still
targets the intended Mario state.

Consequently a negative endpoint from clean zero now implies one of seven
precise failures: late landing without clean provenance, changed descriptor,
changed action/timer/input, retargeted callback, changed Mario-state identity,
an unclassified typed internal write, or an unframed external effect.  The
first six have no generated clean producer in the current audit; the last is a
missing environment specification, not evidence of a gameplay route.  If the
live projection and reached-external frames are supplied, the negative-seed
branch is disproved within successful in-bounds CompCert execution and the X/Z
transport search becomes unnecessary.

The strongest writer is more dangerous than the earlier `-2.65f` example.
`mario_execute_moving_action` updates quicksand from Mario's floor at the
start of the moving-action dispatch.  Later in the same action,
`common_landing_action` calls `perform_ground_step`, then tests Mario's new
floor and applies

```text
(4 - actionTimer) * 3.5f - 0.5f
```

to `quicksandDepth`.  If the first sample is ordinary floor and the ground
step crosses onto quicksand, the updater resets depth to `+0.0f` but the later
writer sees quicksand.  The exact binary32 candidate results are:

| Post-increment timer | Same-frame result |
|---:|---:|
| 4 | `-0.5f` |
| 5 | `-4.0f` |

The older `-2.650000095f` result remains valid when the pre-action updater
already sees quicksand and prepares `1.1f + 0.25f` before timer 5 subtracts
`4.0f`.  It is not the worst floor-transition result.

## Why long-jump landing is the stock late-timer candidate

`common_landing_cancels` increments `actionTimer` before comparing it with the
selected landing descriptor's frame count.  Eight ordinary landing
descriptors use four frames, so their bodies run only with timers 1 through 3.
The long-jump landing descriptor uses six frames, so its body can run with
timers 1 through 5.  The new bilateral census proves all nine generated
landing-descriptor frame counts: eight use four frames and only the long-jump
descriptor uses six.  It also checks the exact writable long-jump descriptor
payload, the two action dispatch sites, the airborne landing transition, and
the A-guarded indirect landing callback.  These are generated-AST facts, not
yet a proof that the writable descriptor retains that payload in every linked
retail state.

The generated constructor source shape and finite transition kernel guard the
ordinary `ACT_LONG_JUMP` transition with `INPUT_A_PRESSED`.  Therefore the
floor-transition arithmetic is not by itself a counterexample to the no-A
claim.  A clean zero-A counterexample still needs
one of:

- a reachable long-jump/long-jump-landing prehistory that does not contain an
  A edge;
- a forged action, timer, descriptor, or callback through a defined alias or
  specified external write; or
- a proof that the modeled interval can legally start in this state despite
  the clean-entry contract.

`LongJumpProvenanceBoundary.v` proves the corresponding first-occurrence
theorem over a finite source transition kernel: starting with the stock entry
action, a trace with no A-edge event and no forged install cannot reach
`ACT_LONG_JUMP` or `ACT_LONG_JUMP_LAND`.  It classifies forgery escapes as
descriptor corruption, interaction/callback retargeting, MarioState aliasing,
external mutation, or an unclassified internal writer.  The linked
whole-program step classification and exact external effects remain open.  An
OOB store is retained only as a deferred retail-machine possibility.  The
source census finds no explicit address-taking of the sensitive scalar fields,
but that alone does not close the defined escapes.

## Walking backward from the first negative seed

The useful question is whether a **negative depth can survive until the sink
reads it**, starting from the accepted nonnegative entry. Looking only for a
negative intermediate calculation is insufficient: the quicksand-jump landing
path immediately clamps its subtraction back to a positive value. The earlier
writer inventory already separates that path from the ordinary landing write
that has no such clamp.

The new [landing execution proof](../../proofs/InkLandingExecution.v) follows
the real selected US/JP write: read depth, read timer, evaluate the generated
Float32 expression, and store its result. The
[arithmetic proof](../../proofs/InkLandingArithmetic.v) shows that timers zero
through three cannot turn a finite nonnegative depth into a finite negative
depth, including rounding. The
[stock-duration consequence](../../proofs/InkNegativeDepthBackward.v) uses
that actual execution rather than the older integer arithmetic model.

| Walk backward from | Required earlier fact | What is proved, and what is still needed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sinking raises the displayed position | Its entry depth is negative. | Proved for the complete actual sink under the ordinary storage and finite-value conditions. |
| The ordinary landing write first makes depth negative | The timer actually read by that write is at least four. | Proved for the actual US/JP reads, rounded calculation and store. Other reached depth writers still need their full live classification. |
| A stock landing reaches that late write | It uses the six-frame long-jump landing, at timer four or five. | Proved **if the timer at this write satisfies the stock duration gate**. Deriving that condition across the preceding call and its intervening helpers remains open. |
| Mario enters long-jump landing | Mario previously entered long jump. | The generated constructor census checks the stock source chain. Its complete live action history still needs connecting. |
| The ordinary crouch-slide branch starts long jump | Its actual input read has the A-pressed bit set. | The new real-guard proof excludes the branch when that bit is clear. Connecting the bit to a physical A edge, and covering every earlier action/input change, remains open. |

The [A-guard proof](../../proofs/InkLongJumpGuard.v) derives the tested input
from MarioState memory; it does not assume the temporary used by the branch.
When the pressed bit is clear, the actual guard has no memory effect and
returns normally to the rest of crouch slide. It cannot execute the launch
return. This is about the game's **pressed** flag, not merely holding A.
The controller history at the accepted boundary must determine whether any
press edge has occurred.

Under the already-checked source and stock-timing rules, long jump remains
the only surviving ordinary producer of a negative seed, and its first entry
requires A. **The universal statement that no clean no-A gameplay history can
produce the seed is still unproved.** Closing it means deriving the same-timer
duration condition from the actual caller, preserving the real descriptor and
Mario identity, following the first long-jump entry back through every action
change to the controller, and accounting for every reached depth writer and
outside call. These are continuity and coverage requirements, not known
alternative routes. No arbitrary memory modification is used or developed by
this search.

Do not narrow the dangerous case to timer five alone. If the earlier floor
sample resets depth to zero and the later landing test sees quicksand, timer
four yields `-0.5`; timer five yields `-4`. The older `-2.65` example has a
different earlier floor sample. Thus the complete exclusion must cover both
late timers and both floor readings. If that exclusion is proved, the clean
negative-seed branch is closed before any dialog transport search is needed.

These new cuts are included in
`MainTheorem.current_ink_backward_execution_boundary` and the active
`check-ink-backward` build/assumption checks. They retain the earlier
defined-producer census without promoting its source-shaped action model to
a completed whole-game execution proof.

## The unreanchored action

`ACT_READING_AUTOMATIC_DIALOG` is a cutscene action.  It is not dispatched by
`mario_execute_automatic_action`, whose prefix resets `quicksandDepth` to zero.
The generated US and JP handlers for the reading action contain no recognized
direct depth write and no recognized direct State-to-Graphics position copy.
While a dialog is
open, the handler increments state 9 to 10, observes that the dialog remains
open, and restores state 9.  The finite scheduling model therefore permits an
arbitrarily long stall.

Every valid-floor Mario update still calls `sink_mario_in_quicksand` after
action dispatch.  That sink subtracts depth from Graphics Y.  A negative depth
therefore raises Graphics.  The finite model shows accumulation when the same
depth is supplied through a constructor/reanchor and later dialog frames.  It
does not prove that live Clight constructor/helper calls preserve that cell;
this is an explicit remaining frame obligation.

Exact CompCert binary32 checks now include both candidates:

- `-2.650000095f` reaches a zero-base endpoint of at least 960 after 363
  sinks; the earlier live-base witness reaches an integer gap of 1010 after
  381 sinks;
- exact single-frame `-4.0f` plus the integer scheduling model proves that 240
  four-unit sinks supply a 960-unit rise.  The corresponding 240-step
  binary32 recurrence from a live base remains a named obligation.

These are arithmetic sufficiency results, not reachable frame traces.

## Stock SSL Area-1 boundary candidate

The stock Area-1 collision mesh has a particularly relevant boundary.  The
default triangle `(120,473,125)` and shallow-moving-quicksand triangle
`(120,125,61)` meet along the horizontal edge from `(5248,0,4864)` to
`(6272,0,4864)`.  Static triangle evaluation gives:

| Sample | Candidate projected triangle | Plane Y |
|---|---|---:|
| `(5760,0,4856)` | default | `0` |
| `(5760,0,4900)` | shallow moving quicksand | about `-8.108108` |

The original samples are 44 units apart in Z, and the rational plane change is
well under the 100-unit leave-ground threshold.  The four retail ground
quarters have now been executed from injected late-long-jump fixtures in both
authenticated target ROMs.  Pre-timer-3 and pre-timer-4 fixtures, which enter
timer-4 and timer-5 bodies, produced the same geometry trace in US and JP:

| Quarter | Z | floor Y | floor | wall | ceiling |
|---:|---:|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | `4867.0` | `-0.675691783` | static type 37 | null | null / `20000` |
| 2 | `4877.73096` | `-2.92787266` | static type 37 | null | null / `20000` |
| 3 | `4888.46191` | `-5.40540886` | static type 37 | null | null / `20000` |
| 4 | `4899.19287` | `-7.88282061` | static type 37 | null | null / `20000` |

Each run hit exactly four lower-wall, upper-wall, floor, ceiling, and normal
commit sites.  Every floor had flags zero and object owner null.  The exact
final bits are Z `0x4599198b` and Y `0xc0fc4011`.  This refutes the earlier
obligation's exact endpoint `4900`: after the first crossing, subsequent
quarters are scaled by the shallow-quicksand normal Y.  The instrumentation
establishes the conditional retail engine execution, not clean reachability
of the injected action/timer/velocity state.  Its Rocq trace certificate is a
transparent record of the authenticated observations, not an oracle linking
emulator execution to Clight semantics.

The matching retail symbol maps were recovered from a clean build at decomp
revision `36fbf8d693a9fc2bdec0c77402f8e96d07d2f461`, whereas the formal project
is pinned to `9921382a68bb0c865e5e45eb594d9c64db59b1af`.  A read-only Git
comparison found no differences between those revisions in `mario.c`,
`mario_step.c`, `mario_actions_moving.c`, `surface_collision.c`, `math_util.c`,
`surface_load.c`, or the SSL Area-1 collision source.  This source-equivalence
receipt explains why the trace is relevant; it is still not a semantic
simulation theorem.  The probe separately hashes the authentic US and JP ROMs
before execution.

## Why the star/dialog handoff remains open

A star collision on the same pre-action collision pass would select the star
dance before moving dispatch, so it would prevent this frame from writing the
negative depth.  For an *older, already tangible* no-exit star, the candidate
scheduling shape is:

1. frame F performs the long-jump-landing boundary crossing and writes the
   negative depth;
2. frame F+1's object collision pass touches an already tangible no-exit star
   before any ordinary action dispatcher can clamp/reset the depth;
3. star dance preserves the scalar and eventually selects
   `ACT_READING_AUTOMATIC_DIALOG` after a star-count milestone;
4. the open dialog stalls while the sink accumulates Graphics Y.

The finite freshly spawned 100-coin-star lifecycle model uses a different
schedule, supported by generated object-list/behavior source-shape receipts:
the first post-clear collision pass has no hitbox, the modeled uninjected gap
frame runs, and only the later level-object update installs a hitbox for the
next collision pass.  The modeled behavior initially places home Y 250 units
above Mario and does not immediately install its hitbox.  In that finite
schedule, action 2 clears time stop, the following
collision pass still sees no hitbox, Mario receives one unstopped update, and
the later level-object update installs the hitbox for the next collision
pass.  That intervening update does **not** eliminate both landing cases.  A
post-timer-4 `-0.5f` state is clamped and incremented to `1.35f`, advances to
timer 5, and receives the `-4.0f` landing delta, ending at exact binary32
`-2.650000095f` (`0xc029999a`).  A post-timer-5 `-4.0f` state advances to timer
6 and exits before the landing body; the same action loop then reaches the
stationary updater and ends at positive `1.85f`.
The finite timing model therefore carries the first case into the star's first
eligible collision rather than eliminating that modeled route.  Linked branch
and lifecycle execution remain open.

The immediate successor of the prepared pre-timer-3 retail fixture has now
also been executed without another memory injection.  In both US and JP,
frame G performs four additional normal commits on static owner-null type-37
floors; every lower/upper wall and ceiling result is null, `gMarioPlatform`
remains null, and the live A-down/A-pressed fields and A poll counts remain
zero.  Its exact endpoint is:

| Field | Binary32 word | Value |
|---|---|---:|
| raw/Object Y | `0xc199271e` | `-19.1441002` |
| raw/Object Z | `0x459aaf5f` | `4949.92139` |
| Graphics Y | `0xc183f3eb` | `-16.4941006` |
| quicksand depth | `0xc029999a` | `-2.6500001` |

This authenticates the proposed timer-5 follow-up for the prepared fixture.
It does not execute the intervening star cutscene/time-stop lifecycle, prove
that the prepared long-jump state is clean-reachable, or connect the run to
linked CompCert memory.

The hand-modeled vertical overlap interval is now the principal known
fresh-star obstruction.  A separately supplied/model-composed star homed at
`spawnY + 250` does not remain exactly at home.  The finite source-order orbit
settles five units below it, at `spawnY + 245`, so the 160/50 hitboxes require
Mario raw Y in `[spawnY + 85, spawnY + 295]`; same-height Mario still cannot
overlap.  The star's first level-list update occurs after Mario's F endpoint
is copied to raw Object, so the prepared binary32 spawn Y is `0xc0fc4011`
(`-7.88282061`), the home Y is `0x43721dff` (about `242.1172`), and the
first-hitbox Y is `0x436d1dff` (about `237.1172`).  A local static-floor scan
found no suitable lower floor near the audited boundary.  The authenticated
successor-frame words sharpen that obstruction: under modeled 160/50 hitbox
fields and zero down offsets, its raw Mario top is more than 96 units below the
supplied first-hitbox Y, and even its higher Graphics top is below the star.
This is exact raw-word arithmetic over two separately supplied finite
artifacts, not a proof that a live star occupied that address or that the
retail overlap routine rejected it in the probed run.  The live hitbox/overlap
refinement, 77-step linked binary32/12k-gate refinement, dynamic
surfaces, coin placement, and transport provenance are not formally closed.
Thus the exact finite pairing is vertically separated under the modeled
hitbox fields, while both a freshly spawned star with a different compatible
Mario height gain and an older
already-tangible star remain explicit obligations rather than assumed objects.

A one-star milestone dialog is possible only when the pre-collection total is
`0`, `2`, `7`, `29`, `49`, or `69`.  Source review confirms that B can advance
the dialog without an A edge; the menu unit is not yet in the imported Clight
coverage.

## Why amplification still does not enter timer 131

`NegativeDepthTimer131Bridge.v` proves spatial separation inside its finite
untransported-dialog model.  The
idealized Z=4900 sample has squared horizontal distance `96058640` from the
fixed upper warp, versus a combined-hitbox squared threshold of only `34969`.
The retail endpoint correction to Z `4899.19287` is irrelevant to the stronger
fact: upper-warp contact requires X between `-2235` and `-1861`, while the
dialog trace retains X=5760.  In the finite untransported-dialog model, any
number of stalls can increase the vertical Graphics/Object gap while State
and raw Object X/Z remain at the supplied boundary sample.  Hence vertical
amplification alone cannot trigger the Area-1 upper warp.

The bilateral generated source-shape check also places
`mario_update_quicksand` before stationary action dispatch and finds the
ordinary idle/walking reanchor helpers.  On the checked stationary
shallow-moving-quicksand update, the exact arithmetic mirror maps both
negative candidates to positive `1.6f`; the moving updater's `.25f` case maps
them to positive `1.35f`.  These facts eliminate “close the
dialog and ordinarily walk to the warp” only after linked branch, pointer,
alias, and helper-frame refinement.  A platform can still move MarioState
during the dialog without the handler directly reanchoring Graphics; proving
or refuting a stock platform capable of the required X/Z transport is now the
most concrete surviving handoff.

## Reproducing the quarter-step receipt

With authenticated US and JP ROMs in the sibling `reference-sm64-decomp`
checkout and the documented emulator/debugger dependencies available, run
from the project root:

```sh
bash instrumentation/area1-long-jump-crossing/run.sh
bash instrumentation/area1-long-jump-next-frame/run.sh
```

The script verifies ROM hashes and the cross-revision source-equivalence
boundary, builds the project-local input/debug plugin, executes all four
version/timer fixtures in the pure interpreter, and fails unless every query,
commit, endpoint, depth, surface-owner, platform-pointer, and no-A-input field
matches the checked CSV receipts.  The second command replays the pre-timer-3
case and its uninjected immediate successor, then validates the second frame's
four quarter-steps and final words.  Runtime logs and binaries go under
`build/instrumentation/` and are not committed.

The runner is not a hermetic emulator toolchain: it expects compatible local
emulator, plugin, compiler, and cheat-database installations.  Exact CSV and
ROM-hash checks reject trace drift, while the clean-build map-to-PC derivation
recorded in `metadata.txt` remains a manual receipt rather than a rebuilt
proof artifact.

## Formal status

The new proof modules establish separate, deliberately scoped facts:

- `JPLongJumpLandingDepth.v` checks the exact binary32 split-floor results and
  the integer magnitude `240 * 4 = 960`.  Its 240-step binary32 recurrence and
  link to the actual Clight ground-step control flow are named pending
  obligations.
- `AutomaticDialogReanchoring.v` checks the bilateral generated handler,
  constructor, dispatcher, sink/copy, and reanchor source shapes, then proves
  the finite stalled-dialog accumulation model.
- `ActionDepthAliasCensus.v` checks a bilateral generated syntax boundary for
  direct writers, address-taking, indirect Mario-state calls, action resets,
  and the writable long-jump descriptor.  Its strengthened whole-corpus result
  excludes source-created untyped/interior pointers, whole-structure copies,
  retained or returned pointers, and initializer-held descriptor aliases.  It
  does not by itself prove the identity of every live function parameter or
  frame a genuine unresolved external.
- `ZeroAQuicksandEntryBoundary.v` proves separate consequences of the abstract
  clean contract, concrete entry-memory postconditions, descriptor timing,
  bilateral 38-unit target-value/constructor census, and the finite
  no-edge/no-forgery source-kernel exclusion.  It does not connect those
  boundaries by linked execution or prove retail memory safety; the initialized
  interaction cause is closed separately below, while the other forgery causes
  remain live-memory obligations.
- `NegativeDepthForgeryBoundary.v` checks the writable descriptors and
  interaction table, localizes their ordinary address/writer sites, proves
  timer-only forgery insufficient for a non-long landing, classifies the two
  indirect MarioState call sites, and proves the CompCert action-cell overlap
  requirement.  It does not prove compiled flat-memory/OOB safety.
- `NegativeDepthInteractionClosure.v` follows all 29 distinct initialized
  interaction handlers in both versions, extracts and checks their 23 direct
  action literals, bounds four local selectors, checks both dynamic knockback
  helpers and all 18 table entries, proves that the two knockback tables have
  no named source writer, and instantiates the stock interaction-action
  closure.  `WritableActionTableAliasExternalClosure.v` strengthens this to
  exact terminal-read-only use and a generic CompCert external frame; the
  private-block injection is constructed at initialization, every reached
  selected Clight step is classified, and the finite-run capstone preserves
  every table byte; only mechanisms outside that successful in-bounds model
  can reopen table mutation.
- `NegativeDepthDefinedProducerClosure.v` gives the combined generated-source
  close-out.  It records all 18 direct depth-store shapes per version, couples
  the temporary writes to the positive death and sinking-speed additions,
  imports the whole-game alias and action-table closures, and proves that a
  clean-zero depth cannot become negative through the checked binary32/source
  traces.  It also defines the exact protected-byte policy for the live state,
  pointer cell, and landing descriptors.  The actual live-step projection and
  reached `EF_external` frames remain explicit inputs rather than assumptions.
- `Area1LongJumpQuicksandCrossing.v` records the static mesh boundary and its
  exact geometric subfacts.  `Area1LongJumpQuicksandRetailTrace.v` records the
  corrected four-quarter retail observation and refutes the old exact-Z
  endpoint.  `Area1LongJumpQuicksandNextFrameTrace.v` records the uninjected
  immediate successor and proves the prepared raw/Graphics arithmetic
  separation against separately supplied first-hitbox words.  A linked Clight
  execution/refinement, live star-memory connection, and clean provenance for
  the injected fixture remain pending.
- `LongJumpProvenanceBoundary.v` checks the bilateral long-jump source chain
  and proves no-edge/no-forgery exclusion in its source transition kernel.
  The new defined-producer closure eliminates the generated alias/table
  candidates; whole-program linked step projection and exact unresolved-call
  effects remain open.
- `NoExitStarDialogBridge.v` checks the bilateral star lifecycle/source shape
  and proves the fresh-star finite schedule, the exact split between the
  surviving post-timer-4 `-2.65f` case and the positive post-timer-5 case, the
  modeled home-Y interval, milestone arithmetic, and boundary/warp separation.
  Its live lifecycle/arithmetic refinement and star-placement closure remain
  open.
- `NegativeDepthTimer131Bridge.v` proves that its finite untransported-dialog
  model preserves the wrong X/Z sample, checks the ordinary idle/walking
  source shape, and checks the exact `1.6f` post-dialog sanitizer arithmetic.
  It does not prove the linked branch/helper execution and names the remaining
  linked transport alternatives.
- `InkTimer131CorruptionClosure.v` now includes the initialized-interaction
  boundary and packages the route consequence: under the checked clean
  action/depth kernels, zero A edges and no forged action imply a nonnegative
  depth, so there is no negative dialog seed; even granting a negative seed
  and any finite number of untransported stalls still cannot overlap the fixed
  upper warp.  Thus a surviving construction needs both a table/alias/external
  or other kernel escape and a separate raw-X/Z transport (or warp/collision
  substitution), not merely more dialog frames.
- `DialogDepthMemoryFrame.v` proves with CompCert memory semantics that framed
  stores to the action/control prefix or distinct object-pool block preserve
  the exact depth word, and checks seven dialog-spine bodies are direct
  nonwriters.  Full statement execution, pointer/alias validity,
  preprocessing, and external frames remain open.

No theorem in these modules proves that a clean US or JP zero-A execution
installs the gap, reaches either target region, or collects either target star.

## What the backward Ink proof adds

The [backward Ink audit](ink-backward-search.md#the-entire-post-action-quicksand-sink-is-now-checked)
now follows the entire selected US/JP sink call, including its optional
drawing-matrix write. With ordinary separate storage, it preserves Mario's
movement record and raw collision height and subtracts the entry depth from
the entry display height. For finite values, an upward change requires a
negative entry depth; rounding with nonnegative depth supplies no alternative.
This proves a necessary condition in actual call execution, not that the
negative seed or stalled-dialog history is reachable. The live entry storage,
finite values, seed provenance and later transport requirements remain open.

## Decisive remaining obligations

1. Refine every reached clean US/JP Clight step to the checked action/depth
   cases while preserving the intended Mario-state identity.  The generated
   alias, initialized interaction, and writable-table branches are closed, so
   the first failure must now be a concrete changed descriptor/control value,
   retargeted callback, changed live-state identity, or unclassified typed
   store. This includes connecting the actual landing write's timer to the
   earlier duration gate and the `Controller.buttonPressed`-to-`INPUT_A_PRESSED`
   update. The local late-timer and A-guard execution cuts above do not yet
   supply either connection.
2. Refine both authenticated four-quarter retail frames to linked Clight
   memory, including the exact injected prestate, successor chronology, and
   corrected binary32 endpoints.
3. Prove or refute a fresh 100-coin star whose vertical placement overlaps
   after the surviving timer-5 `-2.65f` write, or an *older*, already-tangible
   stock no-exit star at the required collision pass.
4. Execute the collision-to-star-dance-to-milestone-dialog path without an
   intervening depth reset and with a non-null floor on every sink frame.
5. Prove every reached genuine `EF_external` call unreachable or give it the
   exact protected-byte frame for Mario's input/action/timer/depth, the live
   state-pointer cell, and all landing descriptors; any legitimate overlapping
   effect must instead be refined as a checked writer. Outside-model
   memory/code modification remains deferred and is not part of this search.
6. Find or exclude the required raw-X/Z transport during the dialog (including
   active platform displacement), warp relocation/substitution, collision
   aliasing, and other post-copy writers before carrying the three-view state
   into timer 131 and the destination stale-platform trace.
