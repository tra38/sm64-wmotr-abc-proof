# The stopped crawl and remembered floor

The source permits a useful direction of change: a stopped crawl can refresh
display from movement, then snap movement down to its remembered floor. The
new Coq connection follows the actual generated US/JP ground return, speed
guard and alignment call to that snap. It does not establish a reachable
large snap, a completed action with a retained gap, or Ink installation.

## What the stopped lookup actually does

The quarter-step's two wall corrections operate on the intended local vector.
The next real `find_floor` reads that corrected vector. Its answer is held in
the quarter-step's local floor and height, separate from Mario's remembered
floor and height. The new query proof resolves the real selected callee and
uses its completed memory effects to preserve movement Y and remembered
height. The local output is fresh at the actual quarter entry; it cannot alias
the existing MarioState block.

A failed lookup returns before installing a new floor. A high intended pose
more than 100 above the local queried floor either leaves the ground or stops
against the ceiling; the existing checked tail distinguishes those exits.
Finding a low local floor on this stopped step therefore does **not** supply a
low remembered height for the later snap. The remembered value needs an
earlier writer. The surrounding wall, ceiling and water calls and the reason
this stopped outcome is reached remain separate execution connections.

## The new caller connection

The real ground display refresh copies movement into display even when a
quarter stopped. Its following real `vec3s_set`, return dispatch and local
free preserve movement Y, remembered floor height, display and collision
position cells. This proof covers the actual angle stores and fresh storage,
not an assumed harmless helper.

On the reached stopped result, crawling checks speed, optionally invokes the
real speed setter, and falls through to `align_with_floor`. Either speed-check
outcome preserves the relevant position and cached-height cells. The first
alignment store copies the actual remembered height into movement while the
Object pool, including display, still contains the refreshed height. At this
snap, the exact display-minus-movement gap is the pre-snap movement height
minus the remembered floor height. Agreement is not assumed: the claim also
covers a downward snap if an earlier history supplied those different values.

The caller's switch reads the result of the same actual completed ground-step
call. The new return-to-switch connection derives that result and the returned
memory; it does not independently supply a stopped value to the switch.

The composition starts at the reached ground-refresh cut, with the actual
entry/return/free and caller dispatch. It does not derive the quarter loop or
the terrain-sound prefix from a normally initialized start. Crouch slide has
additional intervening calls and is not covered by this crawling result.

## What the matrix tail settles

The completed alignment call exposes its actual matrix call and final pointer
assignment. The final assignment writes `gfx.throwMatrix`, not either position
vector or MarioState. Its matrix pointer comes from the real global matrix;
ordinary global-symbol separation prevents aliasing MarioState or the Object
pool. That final store preserves the position records.

The matrix helper's own direct stores target the matrix or fresh local scratch.
Its ten helper calls are checked in the generated source: three floor queries,
a vector setter, the perpendicular-vector helper, three normalizations and two
cross products. Each normalization reaches `sqrtf`. Those callee effects have
not been composed into a complete matrix-call frame here. The position proof
for the final store starts **after** that matrix call. It cannot transfer the
snap's gap across the preceding calls by assuming they are harmless. The
remaining crawling animation/sound calls and later raw-position copy also
need matching execution boundaries.

The warp interaction has already run before this action. A gap created by
crawling cannot help that earlier check in the same update. A proposed
next-update use must survive the tail, raw collision copy and next geometry
preparation, while retaining the needed contact and support.

## How large: bounds versus detections

These are different records and different checkpoints. Original's supplied
display/movement example needs 1170.8648681640625; Variant's supplied
movement/collision example needs 1093. Neither is a universal Ink minimum.

| Mechanism | Theoretical result we actually have | Highest detected in the reviewed receipts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accepted floor quarter, refresh and snap | **0 display gap** at that snap. | No new useful floor producer detected in this batch. |
| Stopped crawl and lower remembered floor | Exact gap is pre-snap height minus remembered height; **no reachable maximum proved**. From 1938.864868 to a remembered 1280 it is 658.864868; to a remembered 768 it is 1170.864868. These are conditional arithmetic cases, not derived live floors. | No gameplay-created stopped-crawl maximum measured. An absence of measurements is not a bound of zero. |
| Specified nonrotating platform tail | **0 new vertical movement** when its reached local Y matches incoming movement Y. A rotating/live-support maximum remains open. | **0 new vertical movement** in the 56 sampled pre-refresh rides in the existing dialog-support receipt. Their horizontal movement and inherited display gap do not count as a platform-created vertical gap. |
| Bounded bounce snap | At most **Y=1018** with actor raw position Y at most 768 and live height at most 250 within the proved finite range: at most 250 above baseline 768. This bounds the named snap, not all flight or display/collision gaps. | No gameplay-created bounce maximum measured in the reviewed receipts. |
| Negative depth and dialog | Retained -4 for 293 consecutive real sink calls gives **1172 units** from display 768. This is sufficient arithmetic, not a maximum or a reached dialog. Under the accepted classified no-A seed contract, upward sinking is **0**. | **1834 display/movement units**, produced by real sinking after supplied depth -0.5, dialog and Tox Box support. It refreshes on release and does not install Ink. |

The detected maximum comes from the existing finite
[`jp-dialog-support-search/expected-results.json`](../../instrumentation/jp-dialog-support-search/expected-results.json).
All 68 recorded trials have `maxGap <= 1834`. For example, `k3-t41-p0`
starts with all three positions at Y=105; 3668 actual -0.5 sink calls raise
display to 1939. The setup supplies the negative seed, automatic-dialog state
and support placement. All 68 find a floor and refresh on release; none has a
useful first retry. All 56 trials recording pre-refresh movement keep the same
Y as their release pose. These are measurements of supplied conditional
continuations, not clean no-A starting histories. No new runtime trials were
run for this report.

## Remaining producer question

Find an earlier ordinary writer that leaves high movement with a much lower
remembered floor, then derive the corrected query and actual stopping exit.
Only then can the snap formula be sized against the geometry. Next, compose
the real matrix/action tail and collision copy to establish the surviving
positions at the next relevant contact. This makes the candidate more
specific; it neither rules the family out nor supplies the missing low cache.

The new registered modules are `InkStoppedFloorQuery`, `InkGroundReturnFrame`,
`InkStoppedCrawlAlignment` and `InkFloorAlignmentTailFrame`. Their actual
execution cuts are bundled in `InkConcreteProducerBoundary` and exposed by
`MainTheorem.current_ink_stopped_floor_producer_boundary`, also through the
existing concrete-producer and backward-history boundaries. The composition
does not assert coverage of every gameplay history.

Validation receipt: `20261004-200321-m_64kz9h` passes the selected repository
audit with Coq 8.16.1, CompCert 3.15 and the `sm64-item-proof` switch. All 634
registered sources pass inventory checks, with 462/556 proof modules in the
main import closure and 94 standalone. Compilation, proof-hole/link discipline,
integration and all 13 selected foundation checks pass. The backward boundary
has nine allowed foundations; the other twelve selected statements have seven
each. These counts do not discharge their explicit gameplay conditions. The
catalog regeneration/check and its five code tests also pass. No new axioms or
proof holes were added, and no new runtime search was run.
